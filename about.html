            <p class="p3">I started designing 7 years ago because my best friend and I wanted to make a YouTube channel
              for our gaming clan. We used to ball out on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and we made quite a
              few montages back in our day. In order for our clan "KhaotiiK Gaming" to look legit, I needed

              To do this, I taught myself design and editing by watching YouTube tutorial videos. I'd do this

              continued to do it throughout high school. I designed whenever I could, and used various outlets
              like student government campaigns to practice my skills. The big turning point for me in high school
               was when I joined a class specifically surrounding sports media. Designing advertisements and posters
                for our sports teams was an absolute blast, and I really started to get good at it. This momentum
                followed me to college at Texas A&M.. And that's where the real growth began. </p>

        <h3>The Volta</h3>
        <p class="p3">When I got to A&M, I sought out any and every opportunity to design. First, working in
          the Marketing department at A&M, and designing fun t-shirts for my fraternity. Then, in
          the spring of my sophomore year I joined The Owner's List. This is when I started to make
          real money for my very real skills. Designing logo, advertisements, user interfaces,
          everything. It was a trial by fire in many ways, and it only compounded my growth. In the
          year and a half since joining and eventually leaving The Owner's List, I have seen a huge
          uptake in my skills in every category.
          <br>
          <br>
          I fell in love with web and app (UI) design. Then, more recently, I taught myself front-end web
          development so I could finally make a website from start to finish - design and code. It killed me
          to hand off my designs and not control exactly how they turned out, and I also felt inadequate in
          the fact that the developers had a skill I didn't have. So over the month of December 2016, I became <span>a unicorn<span>. </p>

          <h4>What is a unicorn?</h4>
          <p class="p3">A unicorn is a designer who codes. They are pretty rare, hence the name "unicorn". Being
            a unicorn is not my end goal, I want to continue to grow as a designer and to learn much
            more than front-end development. </p>

        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p class="p3">I am still only a junior in college, so I plan on teaching myself as much as I can before I
          graduate - in order to have as many options as possible. The next skill I plan on acquiring is
          a toss up between learning back-end web development and app development. We'll see. My main goal
          is to be the best <span>T-shaped creative<span> I can be.

        <h3>What is a T-Shaped Creative?</h3>
        <p class="p3">A T-shaped creative is my own twist on what a T-shaped designer is.. Which is a
          simple concept explained by the capital letter "T".
          <br>
          <br>
          The top of the T is general knowledge, and the lower you get, the more specialized the skills
          and knowledge become. So the bottom of the T is my "UI Design" because it's my strongest skill.

        <p class="p3">A T-shaped creative is someone who is able to be multifaceted in their creative skills.
          Someone who has general knowledge of a lot of areas, but then hones in their skills to
          specialize in 1-3 areas.
          <br>
          <br>
          My areas of general knowledge are: videography/editing, advertisement design, print design,
          and photography.</p>

        <p class="p3">The purpose of being a good T-shaped creative is to be able to collaborate well and to
          provide most any solution a client needs.
          <br>
          <br>
          Collaboration is extremely important because I know that I will always need to work alongside
          other people for the rest of my life. Being able to understand what everyone's role is very
          important to me, because I believe intelligent communication is dependent on depth of subject knowledge.
          <br>
          <br>
          Providing for a client is obviously important because half of the reason I do what I do is to
          see the look on someone's face when you present them something that they are blown away by.
          So, if I am skilled in many areas, I can do most anything they want - and do it well.
